In my time as a hiring manager, I’ve reviewed thousands of resumes, ranging from senior candidates with 10+ years of experience to new college and bootcamp graduates. When I’m reviewing candidates, I always try to give them the benefit of the doubt on things like resume structure and formatting, but at the end of the day I can only evaluate people based on the information they provide. So I’m writing this post to explain a bit about what I look for in a technical resume, and some of the things that make resumes more or less effective.

#### What’s a resume for?

Put yourself in the shoes of someone hiring for a job. They’re trying to find someone great to join their team, and they post a job online, likely receiving many applications if it’s a good position. A resume is the document the hiring manager or recruiter looks at to decide who should get an interview -- the first filter in the process.

Generally, the reader can only spend a minute or two on each resume; if it catches their interest then they’ll dive into more depth, looking at supporting materials, online profiles, etc. So it’s to your advantage to make the strongest, most concise case you can about your fit for the role.

#### Focus on your relevant experience

When I’m reading through a resume, I’m looking for concrete evidence that this candidate will do well at the role I’m hiring for. Really, I’m looking for two things:

1. Will this person quickly pick up the technical skills and experience to do the job? This doesn’t mean they’ve necessarily worked with the specific technology we use, but more that I have confidence they could learn our stack.
2. Is this person good at getting work done and collaborating with a team? Even if someone is a fast learner or has academic knowledge, being an effective team member is a critical skill for any role.

The key here is show, don’t tell. Anyone can write that they know JavaScript or that they’re a strong communicator -- I need evidence that shows that the candidate has proven themselves in the relevant areas.

This is best demonstrated by previous professional experience or equivalent project work, which should make up the majority of the resume if possible. I’m interested to know not just what role the candidate held, but what they actually did and why it was interesting. For example, this isn’t that interesting:

> **Software Engineer II at SoftwareCo**<br />
> Participated in engineering sprints and collaborated with teammates to ship features quickly with a high quality implementation. Worked across the stack with a JavaScript frontend and a Ruby backend.

This provides much more information in the same space:

> **Software Engineer II, Photos team at SoftwareCo**<br />
> Led team of 3 engineers to rewrite photo uploader to use a streaming API to reduce upload time by 37%, increasing number of photos uploaded per user by 15%. Led user research and technical scoping.

Writing about work in this way also shows me that the candidate understands the impact of what they are doing, beyond implementing pre-specified features. Focus on specifics, numbers, and results as much as possible.

#### Don’t be too humble

It often happens that when I’m interviewing someone they tell me about a project on their resume, and it turns out it was way more impressive than it sounded. I’m lucky that they got to the interview stage!

When you’re working as part of a team, it’s good to give other people credit and sometimes downplay your achievements. But when you’re applying for a job, the hiring manager simply won’t know what you did unless you tell them. If you led a project, don’t just say you worked on it. If you came up with an idea or made a key decision, highlight it. Put your best foot forward.

#### Effectively highlight project work

It’s a little trickier if you don’t have as much industry experience, and your resume leans heavily on projects done in a more academic or independent setting. My suggestion here is to reach for projects that produce a real-world result. For example, you could build an app for your friends to post progress on their knitting projects, or to plan out complex architecture projects in The Sims, or to create art that you post on an Instagram account.

Building a project that has some kind of result other than just learning has a few benefits:

1. I can check that your project actually works -- either by logging in and trying it myself, or by reading about how other people used it.
2. There are some aspects of development that only come into play when something is actually live and being used -- error handling, deployment, getting feedback from users, etc. This can act as a stand-in for job experience to some extent.

If you highlight personal projects, make sure to talk about what it does and why, not just the technologies you used -- that’ll help differentiate it from other educational projects and make it feel more real.

#### Listing non-tech experience

I’ve often interviewed folks who switched from a different career into software development. If you don’t have enough tech work experience yet to fill out a resume, my advice is to definitely put your non-tech experience, and follow some of the tips above to talk about your impact there.

Your non-tech experience might not show off the technical skills you’ve learned, but it can go a long way towards showing that you’re an effective team member and know how to get things done -- which is just as valuable as the technical bits.

#### Prioritization, length, and what not to put

In terms of length, I agree with the recommendation of one page for every 10 years of experience. It’s hard to fit everything on one page, but it’s an opportunity to make that page really shine by focusing on your absolute greatest hits. The only job of the resume is to get you the interview, and you can get into the details during the interviews if needed.

If you need to make more space, I’d suggest coming back to the idea of “show, don’t tell”. Slim down your “skills” section and talk more about your experience. Focus on the projects and roles that had the most impact.

One thing I’d suggest leaving out is large visual ornamentation -- I’d pretty much always prefer more content, or a larger font to make things easier to read.

#### Supporting materials

While I suggest keeping the actual resume short and sweet, you can add more pizazz by linking to supporting materials. This can be a portfolio site, GitHub account, a site or app you worked on, or anything else. Note that a resume can absolutely stand on its own -- I don’t hold it against folks that don’t link to anything -- but an exciting project or demo can really add to an application.

The main issue I often come across here is when applicants link to supporting materials that don’t work or haven’t been prepared at all. It’s discouraging to click on someone’s personal website link, and see that the site is down, or click on a GitHub link and see that there are no repositories at all. Go through all the links you’re providing, and make sure that a hiring manager would be excited to see them; otherwise, just leave it out.

If you are linking to a GitHub and you have some repositories on there, I’d suggest taking some time to polish up the presentation. Ensure all your featured repos have a README that explains what’s interesting about the project, and possibly include a personal README to tell me what to look at.

#### Get feedback and a proofread from someone

It might be tempting to see a resume as a personal thing that’s embarrassing to share. But you’re about to hang your hopes for an exciting new job on this document -- at least get someone to read it over first! At the very least, ask someone you trust to look for typos or other mistakes; if you know someone that has experience hiring for tech roles, ask them what could be improved.

At the end of the day, a well-put-together resume won’t change your actual experience or help you pass an interview. But it could be the difference between getting noticed for that dream job and your application getting passed over because the hiring manager didn’t see your potential.
